<h1>Hello world!</h1>
<h2>Nice to meet you!</h2>
<p>I'm fairly new to the coding world, but have programmed off and on since the Commodore 64 days.  Back then, we didn't have access to purchasing programs, so my dad picked up computer science magazines.  I spent hours typing out the code for the games, and if I was lucky they would work.  Usually they didn't.  We didn't have a subscription to the magazines so I spent even longer trying to figure out why the code didn't work. I saves the games to a tape (yes, I actually pre-date disc drives) and hoped my little brother and sister didn't overwrite the programs.  </p>
<p>Fast forward to high school and I took computer science.  We used Hypercard to program point and click games on the Mac.  At that time however, computers didn't really have real world applications for jobs.  I moved into other fields and usedcomputers for work and play but didn't do any more coding for many years.  </p>
<p>About 20 years ago, I was working for an office that created multiple document packages for loan security and membership files.  The process was long and time consuming.  Accuracy was a must.  I don't like repetition much so here is me, with WordBasic, setting up document automation.  My program used macros to set up a .txt file with the name, address and company name and then use that information to create various documents based on selections made by the user.  Ask fields would prompt for additional information needed along the way. The process was now quick and accurate. Documents could be updated when needed by updating the macro or the autotext files.</p>
<p>I moved on to another company and this time, the information I needed to make my job easier was in Excel format.  I used vlookup formulas to lookup product codes and tell me the details of the coverages provided by that product.  It took me years to get it the way I wanted, so recreating it for a different product line with a thousand products instead of the 150 I had used for the first spreadsheet was more daunting than I imagined.  I never did get the second spreadsheet created, but this time the programming bug bit and I was hooked.</p>
<h2> So here I am, starting at the beginning and the middle at the same time.</h2>

<p>I would really appreciate any help or suggestions.  I'm finding that my greatest challenge is trying to determine <em>what</em> I can do vs <em>how</em> to do it.</p>
