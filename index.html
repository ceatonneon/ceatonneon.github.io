<h1>Hello world!</h1>
<h2>Nice to meet you!</h2>
<p>I'm fairly new to the coding world, but have programmed off and on since the Commodore 64 days.  Back then, we didn't have access to purchasing programs, so my dad would pick up computer science magazines.  I would spend hours typing out the code for the games, and if lucky they would work.  Usually they didn't.  We didn't have a subscription to the magazines so I would even longer trying to figure out why the code didn't work. I would save the games to a tape (yes, I actually predate disc drives) and would hope my little brother and sister didn't overwrite the programs.  </p>
<Fast forward to high school and I took computer science.  We used Hypercard to program point and click games on the Mac.  At that time however, computers didn't really have real world applications for jobs.  I moved into other fields and used the computers for work and play but didn't do any more coding for many years.  </p>
<p>About 20 years ago, I was working for an office that created multiple document packages for loan security and membership files.  The process was long and time consuming.  Accuracy was a must.  I don't like repetition much so here is me, with WordBasic, setting up document automation.  My program used macros to set up a txt file with the name address and company name and then use that information to create various documents based on selections made by the user.  Ask fields would prompt for additional information needed along the way. The process was now quick and accurate. Documents could be updated when needed by updating the macro or the autotext files.</p>
